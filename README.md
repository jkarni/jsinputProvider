# JsInput Provider

Simplifies the development process for jsinputs by providing directly linkable
source files for jsinput providers. All that should be needed is something
like:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.github/jsinputProvider/master/edxJS.js"></script>

If it works, anyhow.
